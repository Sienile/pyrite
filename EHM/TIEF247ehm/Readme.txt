Description:
The SSD Avenger is docked for routine repairs and maintenance. It is at this vulnerable time that the TIE Drones that usually protect the shipyards contract a computer virus and begin attacking the repair crews. The base on the planet receives a distress call from the shipyard and sends two TIE Advanced to do what they can until more help can arrive.
