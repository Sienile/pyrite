THE 34th BATTLE PLOTLINE APPROVED FOR THE EMPEROR'S HAMMER!

Mission Profile
{Encounter at Charybdis}
by
FM/GN Lee/Cobra-1/ISD Vanguard

Brief:  You are assigned to the M/CRV Byzantium in the Charybdis System.  The Byzantium is doing routine recon work around Rebel concentrations in an attempt to gather more information on the system for a possible Emperor's Hammer annexation.  Several discoveries are made, but soon the Byzantium has got more than she bargained for. Crack EH ships/pilots are needed to save her.

Mission # 1:   Recon

Mission #2:  Capture Operation

Brief:  T/F Alpha's inspections from last mission have revealed a top ranking Rebel spy (Codename: Shade) onboard the passenger liner Sahbo.  Shade has apparently commandeered the bridge of the passenger liner and is making his way to a rendevous with his Rebel contacts.  The passengers, loyal Imperial citizenry, are being used by Shade as a pitiful attempt to shield himself should he be discovered.  Gun Mu (You) and TRN Harpy will make a concerted effort to disable and capture the liner.  Speed is of the essence, however, since Shade has managed to send a distress signal to his Rebel cohorts.

Mission #3:  Sitting Duck Gambit

Brief:  During the last mission, the M/CRV Byzantium sustained damage to its hyperdrive and long-range communication system.  A Rebel task force has arrived, and they are particularly upset to see us rather than the spy they were to rendvous with!  They have deployed a modified arrary of TYPE A probes that screen them from long-range Imperial scans and serve as a crude early warning system should any ship enter the sector.  They no doubt intend to capture or destroy the M/CRV Byzantium.  Our only hope lies destroying the probes, inspecting the Rebel capital ships, and escaping to Imperial space.  This can only be accomplished by GUN Mu (You), our only hyperdrive capable craft.  To make matters worse, GUN Mu's shield generators were damaged during the last battle, and we haven't time to repair them.

	GUN Mu must have survived
	100% of Carrack Crusier Group Renaldo must be inspected

All other ships initially present.

Mission #4:  Scour Adjacent Sectors In Search Of M/CRV Byzantium

Brief:  You successfully destroyed the probes and escaped with valuable information.  You come out of hyperspace near a TIE Advanced patrol.  After explaining your situation, you are immediately escorted aboard the waiting ISD Vanguard and make your report to its commander.  A short hyper-jump by a recon team reveals that the Rebels and the M/CRV have fled.  A Secret Order member privately informs you that the Byzantium was conducting a special espionage mission.  Unfortunately, its computers contain information relating to security, fleet strength, and secret locations of Emperor's Hammer forces.  It is standard procedure to self-destruct any vital materials in the event of capture, but we cannot be certain that the Byzantium's commander had the chance.  The information aboard the Byzantium computers is well encrypted, and the ship would have to be taken to an advanced facility, such as a base, in order to hack its system.  A massive recon effort is under way to find the M/CRV Byzantium and the Rebel convoy.  T/A Group Beta (You) will check Sector 4E.

Primary Goals:
	M/CRV Byzantium must be inspected
	100% of Escort Shuttle Group Gar must be inspected

Secondary Goals:
	Nebulon-B Frigate Mastiff must be inspected
	Carrack Crusier Renaldo must be inspected

Mission #5:   Recapture the M/CRV Byzantium

Brief:  Your excellent recon work in the last mission paid off!  We were able to ascertain from your scans that the M/CRV Byzantium's computer system is still intact, and the Rebels tampering has yielded them nothing!  Unfortunately, the Byzantium's crew was being held prisoner in the cargo bay.  The Rebel convoy was also carrying some interesting technical cargo; we would like to find out that cargo's pupose!  Drive plasma trails trace the convoy to a nearby sector.  T/D Rho (You) and GUN Tau has been given the honor of disabling the capital ships of the convoy.  ATR Pegasus will recapture the M/CRV Byzantium.  The ISD Vanguard will oversee the recapture effort.  A Secret Order operative informs you that the disabled Carrack Crusiers and the Frigate will be part of a trap to snare the Rebel Fleet.  You are informed to attack the Corellian Transports, but let them escape to lure their Rebels friends back here!  Be alert for any starfighter defense the convoy may have scraped together.

Mission #6:  Came Up Empty?

Brief:  The trap we laid for the Rebels yielded nothing.  As a result, the Carrack Crusiers and the Frigate disabled in the last mission will be captured and returned to Imperial space.  TRN Kaiser and Kaiser II, bearing a crack computer hack team will download the Renaldo's and Mastiff's logs to look for clues and other Rebel information.  Perhaps the strangest item of note is the absence of the Byzantium crew and the Rebel supplies.  They were never recovered during the recapture operation, and no other ships were tracked entering or leaving this sector.  T/D Rho (You) and T/B Kappa will perform routine patrol duties.........A Secret Order operative takes you aside and warns you of a disturbance in the Force.  No further information is available, but we will find a way to contact you when we learn more.  Be vigilant and serve the Emperor's Hammer and Dark Brotherhood!

The cloaking generators, cloak technical data, and warp cores that you helped capture will be taken to the Emperor's Hammer Corporate Division for analysis.  You have served the Emperor's Hammer well and have shown that the Charybdis System is ripe for annexation.  Congratulations on a job well done!!!
