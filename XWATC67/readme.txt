Introduction
------------
This battle was constructed as part of The Karana Initiative.

High Admiral Bonini has accumulated a number of ships and set off to engage a prticularly nasty
group of outlaws. Accompanied by the Tactical Officer, and the best pilots he could gather, he
has taken the Imperial-II class Star Destroyer Hammer to the Karana cluster. Cut off from the
rest of the Emperor's Hammer, his mission is simple: bring an end to these outlaws!
