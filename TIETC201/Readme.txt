NOTES:
-Some missions may be difficult. Don't forget that you can fly them on the easier difficulty levels.
-This battle is made to tell a story, not to get you a high score. If you fly it attempting to get a high score, you probably will not enjoy it. In many missions, if you hang around for extra kills after mission goals are complete for too long, invincible enemies will arrive.
